[mutmut]
# The command to run your full Django test suite
# This is crucial for mutmut to work with Django's test runner.

# Directories containing the source code you want to mutate.
# Replace 'your_app_name' with the actual name of your Django app(s).
# If you have multiple apps, separate them with a comma.
# Example: paths_to_mutate=blog/,users/

# Directories containing your test files.
# Django typically finds tests in app/tests/ or app/test_*.py
# If your tests are inside your app directory, e.g., 'your_app_name/tests/',
# you generally don't need this, but defining it can be safer.
